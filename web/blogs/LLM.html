  What are large language models (LLMs)?
A large language model (LLM) is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm that uses deep 
learning techniques and massively large data sets to understand, summarize, generate and predict new 
content. The term generative AI also is closely connected with LLMs, which are, in fact, a type of 
generative AI that has been specifically architected to help generate text-based content.
</p>
Over millennia, humans developed spoken languages to communicate. Language is at the core of all
 forms of human and technological communications; it provides the words, semantics and grammar needed 
 to convey ideas and concepts. In the AI world, a language model serves a similar purpose, providing 
 a basis to communicate and generate new concepts.
<p>
The first AI language models trace their roots to the earliest days of AI. The Eliza language 
model debuted in 1966 at MIT and is one of the earliest examples of an AI language model. All 
language models are first trained on a set of data, and then they make use of various techniques 
to infer relationships and then generate new content based on the trained data. Language models are 
commonly used in natural language processing (NLP) applications where a user inputs a query in 
natural language to generate a result.
</p>
<p>
An LLM is the evolution of the language model concept in AI that dramatically expands the data 
used for training and inference. In turn, it provides a massive increase in the capabilities of 
the AI model. While there isn't a universally accepted figure for how large the data set for 
training needs to be, an LLM typically has at least one billion or more parameters. Parameters are 
a machine learning term for the variables present in the model on which it was trained that can 
be used to infer new content.

Virtual Machines
<p>
From floor zero, a virtual machine is basically a sandboxed environment that can run as
software in an OS. The virtual machine shares all the resources from the OS but anything
happening in a virtual machine is completely devoid of the actual operating system.
Virtual machines can be classified into two types:</p>
<p>
System Virtual Machine SVM
Process virtual Machine PVM</p>
<p>
SVM(system virtual machine)
A system virtual machine is a type of VM where we run a system over a preexisting
operating system this kind of virtualization is made possible with the help of hypervisors. A
type-2 hypervisor helps us to override a new virtual machine on an OS by virtually sharing the
hosts resources, such as memory and processing. While a type-1 hypervisor is directly installed
on the hardware over which we can set up as many virtual machines as we want.
PVM(process virtual machine)</p>
<p>
A process virtual machine allows a single process to run as an applictaion on the host
computer providing a platform-independent programming environment. By masking information
2
Of underlying hardware or operating system. Process virtual machines are implemented using an
interpreter.</p>
<p>
Lets take the example of a Python virtual machine:
A Python interpreter is comprised of a compiler and a virtual machine. The compiler takes the
raw code and then generates a byte code the bytecode which is a low-level representation of
source code is given to a virtual machine that generates a machine code, thereby generalizing the
specifications and making Python a platform-independent language.
The PVM interprets and executes the bytecode, and the PVM itself interacts with the host
machine's CPU to carry out the instructions. The key point is that the VM acts as an intermediary
between the high-level code and the host machine's CPU. It translates or interprets the code into
machine code, allowing the CPU to execute the program. The specifics of how this translation
occurs depend on the design of the VM and the language it supports.</p>
<p>

Different VMs, such as those for Java (JVM), Python (PVM), or the Common Language
Runtime (CLR) in the case of .NET languages, have their own approaches to bytecode execution
and machine code generation. They abstract away the underlying hardware details, providing a
level of portability for programs written in these languages across different platforms.
The bytecode generated can be given to any machine having a PVM and the program will work
perfectly. In contrast with C, we cannot run a.exe on Linux just by changing the extension to
a.out.</p>
<p>
Interaction between (PVM) and host OS:
In the case of dynamic languages like Python, the VM is responsible for handling dynamic
typing, memory management, and other runtime aspects. It interacts with the host machine's
operating system for tasks like memory allocation and file I/O.The PVM often relies on system
calls provided by the host operating system for tasks like file I/O, network communication, and
memory management. These system calls act as interfaces between the PVM and the underlying
hardware.</p>
<p>
The host OS is responsible for managing system resources, and the PVM relies on the OS for
tasks such as memory allocation and process scheduling. If the host OS imposes restrictions or
has resource limitations, it can affect the performance and behaviour of the PVM.
